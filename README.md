# JavaScript-Calculator
A simple calculator made using JavaScript, CSS & HTML.

A project that I have made by researching and following tutorials made by the community.
This has been done to learn the language JavaScript and understand the fundementals.

Creating a calculator has allowed me to understand the basic concept of how the 3 technologies work together,
as well as learning the syntax. 

I have chosen to use Visual Studio Code as the IDE for this project.
I am using GitHub to regularly update, and create a back-up if needed. 

I have added the GPG Signature, and added the key to my profile allowing for verified commits.
